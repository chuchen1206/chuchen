Hello and welcome to my academic personal webpage!

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at City University of Hong Kong, HKSAR, China. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jean-Michel Morel, Prof. Raymond Chan, and Prof. Ronald Lui. My research interests span various areas within computational mathematics, image and signal processing, computational geometry, and deep neural networks.
I am also affiliated with the [Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-cardiovascular Health Engineering (COCHE)](https://www.hkcoche.org), where my research primarily focuses on the processing and analysis of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI images, as well as ultrasound video processing. Prior to my current endeavors, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in the School of Mathematical Science at the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.
