I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) at the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk), HKSAR, China. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jean-Michel Morel](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/jeamorel.htm), [Prof. Raymond Chan](https://www.ln.edu.hk/po/people/professor-raymond-chan-hon-fu), and [Prof. Ronald Lui](http://lokminglui.com). My research interests span various areas within computational mathematics, image and signal processing, computational geometry, and deep neural networks.
I am also affiliated with the [Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-cardiovascular Health Engineering (COCHE)](https://www.hkcoche.org), where my research primarily focuses on the processing and analysis of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI images, as well as ultrasound video processing. Prior to my current endeavors, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.dlut.edu.cn) at the [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn), Dalian, China.
